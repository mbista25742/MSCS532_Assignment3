Sorting and Hash Table Analysis
This repository contains a Python implementation of Randomized Quicksort and Hash Table with Chaining and a detailed analysis of their theoretical and empirical performance.

Repository Structure
quickSort.py: Contains the implementation of Randomized Quicksort.
quickSortComparison.py: Empirically compares the performance of Randomized Quicksort and Deterministic Quicksort (first element as pivot) on various data distributions and sizes.
hashWithChaining.py: Implements a Hash Table with Chaining to handle collisions.
report.pdf: Detailed report covering the theoretical analysis, empirical comparisons, and discussion of results.
README.md: Instructions on running the code and summary of the findings.

Requirements
Python 3.x
No additional libraries are needed

How to Run the Code

QuickSort


Randomized Quicksort:

/ python3 quickSort.py


Comparative Analysis of Quicksort:

/ python3 quickSortComparison.py

This script measures and prints the running times of Randomized Quicksort and Deterministic Quicksort across different data distributions and input sizes.

Hash Table with Chaining

To run the hash table implementation with chaining:

/ python3 hashWithChaining.py


Summary of Findings
The report.pdf in this repository provides a theoretical overview, empirical data, and detailed analysis of both the sorting algorithms and the hash table with chaining.
